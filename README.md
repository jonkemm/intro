  <li>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jonkemm - a family man with experiencee in PHP, mySql, JS, CSS, SCSS, HTML DOM.</li>
<li>ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in front end technologies to build on my knowledge of php & mysql.  I'm pretty much full stack but not ultra experienced.</li>
<li>ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning react & topping up on vanilla js.</li>
  <li>I've just finished developing a game of rock, paper, scissors - feel free to <a href="https://jonkemm.github.com/rock-off">play it here</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/jonkemm/rock-off">here are the files for the game</a></li>
