ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jonkemm - a family man with experiencee in PHP, mySql, JS, CSS, SCSS, HTML DOM.
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in front end technologies to build on my knowledge of php & mysql.  I'm pretty much full stack but not ultra experienced.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning react & topping up on vanilla js.
